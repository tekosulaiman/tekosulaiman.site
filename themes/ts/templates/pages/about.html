  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">About Me</h1>
  <p class="mb-2">
    My name is <strong>Teko Sulaiman</strong>, and I am from <span class="font-semibold">Jakarta, Indonesia</span>. 
    I have been immersed in the world of IT since 2007, completing my studies in 2012. During my university years, 
    I also worked as a <span class="font-semibold">computer lab assistant (2010)</span>, which strengthened my technical foundation 
    and teaching skills.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    After graduating in 2012 as a <strong>fresh graduate</strong>, I began my career as a <strong>technical programmer</strong>. 
    For more than 7 years (2012–2018), I focused on ERP systems, backend development, debugging, and building a strong technical base.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    From 2018 to the end of 2024, my career shifted toward <strong>management roles</strong>: 
    <strong>System Analyst</strong>, <strong>Business Analyst</strong>, <strong>Product Owner</strong>, and <strong>Project Manager</strong>. 
    Each role gave me new perspectives on how technology and strategy interact within digital product teams.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    Counting from 2010 to 2024, I have accumulated more than <strong>14 years of experience</strong>, 
    combining a solid <strong>technical foundation</strong> with <strong>strategic management</strong>. 
    I am using 2025 as a year of transition and reflection, while opening myself to new professional opportunities.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    I believe that a good system is not only about performance, but also about <strong>clarity, scalability, and teachability</strong>. 
    I always aim to find the root cause of problems, not just quick fixes.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    At present, while exploring new professional opportunities, I continue to deepen my knowledge in <strong>management and business</strong> 
    through self-learning and hands-on practice. I experiment with different approaches whether in team development or startup exploration 
    while maintaining my curiosity for both technology and digital strategy.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
  <p class="mb-2">
    My strengths can be seen directly through the content I document on this site. 
    Each article, case study, and reflection is proof of my ability to structure ideas, 
    maintain consistency, and deliver a clear approach to management, technical work, and leadership.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-2">
    My weaknesses, like many professionals, lie in my tendency to be overly detailed and perfectionist 
    when structuring documentation or processes. At times, this can slow things down. 
    However, I view it as an opportunity to keep learning how to balance precision with execution speed.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Current Focus Areas</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Modular architecture & debugging strategy</strong>: a philosophical approach to building resilient, teachable systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic publishing & content optimization</strong>: packaging content in a relevant and sustainable way.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-framework parity & SOP documentation</strong>: creating standards that can be applied across technologies.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow hygiene & build automation</strong>: keeping systems clean, efficient, and easy to maintain.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-8">
    All of these activities are documented as part of my learning and reflection process, 
    forming a <strong>living portfolio</strong> not just a collection of projects, but also a collection of ideas and approaches to work.
