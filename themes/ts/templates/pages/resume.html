  <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Public CV – Teko Sulaiman</h1>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Experienced IT Professional | Project Manager | Business Analyst | Technical Writer</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    With more than <strong>12 years</strong> of experience in information technology, I have built a strong combination of 
    <strong>technical expertise</strong> and <strong>managerial strategy</strong>. My career began in technical roles for 5 years, 
    where I honed problem-solving skills and gained deep knowledge in software development, system integration, and IT infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Building on that foundation, I transitioned into <strong>Project and Product Management</strong>, leading cross-functional teams 
    to deliver high-impact projects on time and efficiently. My ability to align technical solutions with business goals has created 
    tangible value for clients and stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Beyond management, I also have strong expertise in <strong>Business Analysis</strong>, particularly in gathering requirements, 
    conducting gap analysis, and translating complex technical concepts into actionable insights. As a <strong>Technical Writer</strong>, 
    I am experienced in producing clear, concise documentation that bridges communication between technical teams and end-users.
  </p>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Technical Approach</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I began my professional career as a technical developer in 2012. For more than 7 years, I worked directly on ERP systems, backend services, 
    and integration of business modules such as HR, Sales, and Purchase. My main focus was building systems that are modular, well-documented, 
    and easy to maintain.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    My passion for documentation grew naturally from habits like recording debugging processes, structuring WBS, and producing technical documents 
    such as FSD, wireframes, and system architectures. For me, a good system must be explained clearly not only for developers but also for 
    non-technical stakeholders.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li>Backend system development and API integration</li>
    <li>Technical documentation: SRS, FSD, BRD, FTSD, MOM, deployment guides</li>
    <li>System architecture design, database diagrams, and wireframes</li>
    <li>Strategic and documented debugging</li>
    <li>Workflow hygiene and build automation</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Managerial Approach</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    After my technical phase, I moved into managerial and strategic roles. I have served as a <strong>System Analyst</strong>, 
    <strong>Business Analyst</strong>, <strong>Product Owner</strong>, <strong>Project Manager</strong>, and <strong>Business Development Manager</strong>. 
    In these roles, I often acted as the bridge between business needs and technology solutions.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I am experienced in requirement gathering directly with clients, drafting requirement documents, leading daily stand-ups, 
    and managing cross-functional teams. I have also worked with various methodologies including Agile Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, and Prototyping.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li>Requirement gathering and stakeholder communication</li>
    <li>Translating business needs into modular technical solutions</li>
    <li>Team management and task distribution</li>
    <li>User story documentation, acceptance criteria, and project scope</li>
    <li>Manual and adaptive project progress monitoring</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Current Activities</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I am currently focused on professional development through strategic and exploratory approaches. My focus is on expanding knowledge, 
    deepening cross-disciplinary skills, and experimenting with modular and documentation-driven workflows.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
    <li>Studying management and business through MBA-style programs</li>
    <li>Deepening system analysis and design</li>
    <li>Strengthening technical writing and documentation skills</li>
    <li>Exploring product strategy and project management</li>
    <li>Researching niches such as modular architecture, debugging strategies, and SOP documentation across frameworks</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Work Preferences & Availability</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    I am open to different work models, adjusted to the role and responsibilities:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
    <li>
      For <strong>managerial roles</strong> such as Project Manager, Business Analyst, or Product Owner, I am available for 
      <strong>on-site or hybrid work</strong>, especially when compensation and project challenges are aligned.
    </li>
    <li>
      For <strong>technical roles</strong> such as Technical Writer or Developer, I prefer a <strong>remote model</strong>, 
      allowing me to focus on documentation, debugging, and system development independently and efficiently.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">
    I believe work flexibility must remain aligned with productivity, communication, and the value delivered.
