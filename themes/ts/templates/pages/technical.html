    Although since 2018 my professional focus has shifted toward management roles such as SA, BA, PM, and Product Owner,
    I’ve kept my <span class="font-semibold">technical curiosity</span> alive by continuing to write code and experiment
    outside of formal work. This section documents my personal explorations in backend work, debugging, system architecture,
    and modular approaches to development.

    My focus here isn’t only efficiency and scalability, but also <span class="font-semibold">clarity</span> in every line of code
    and in the way systems are structured. The articles below are personal exploration notes proof that coding remains part of my identity,
    even as my main career path has moved toward management.
