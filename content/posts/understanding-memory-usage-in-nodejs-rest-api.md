## 1. Introduction
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the **V8 engine**, well-known for being lightweight and efficient for I/O-driven applications such as REST APIs. The **Express** framework is often chosen for its minimalism and flexibility. Just like with other languages, it’s important to understand the memory footprint when an application first starts.

## 2. Example Application (main.js)
A simple REST API using Express:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const Routes = require('../routes/routers');

const app = express();
const PORT = 8080;

app.use(express.json());
Routes.registerRoutes(app);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
```

## 3. Runtime Memory Data (First Run)
Node.js provides a built-in API, `process.memoryUsage()`, to inspect runtime memory usage.

### 📊 Actual output when running the Express app:
```
Server running on http://localhost:8080
[Startup] Memory Usage: {
  rss: 46084096,
  heapTotal: 12427264,
  heapUsed: 8728936,
  external: 2100602,
  arrayBuffers: 18675
}
```

### 🔍 Interpretation
- **rss (Resident Set Size)** → total memory used by the Node.js process in the OS, about **46 MB**.  
- **heapTotal (12 MB)** → total heap allocated by V8.  
- **heapUsed (8.7 MB)** → heap currently in use for JavaScript objects.  
- **external (2.1 MB)** → memory for external resources (e.g., buffers).  
- **arrayBuffers (18 KB)** → memory used by `ArrayBuffer` and `TypedArray`.  

Comparison with other languages:
- Go: ~6 MB  
- Python (FastAPI): ~42 MB  
- Ruby (Sinatra): ~44 MB  
- Node.js (Express): ~46 MB  
- Java (Spring Boot): ~300 MB  

## 4. Advantages
- Relatively light startup (tens of MB).  
- Easy memory monitoring with built-in APIs.  
- Well-suited for I/O-intensive applications (REST, WebSocket).  

## 5. Drawbacks
- Larger footprint compared to Go.  
- V8 garbage collector can add overhead in large-scale apps.  
- Less efficient for CPU-heavy workloads compared to compiled languages.  

## 6. Solutions / Best Practices
- Use `process.memoryUsage()` or tools like **clinic.js** for profiling.  
- Optimize middleware and dependencies avoid heavy libraries when possible.  
- Use **pm2** or similar monitoring tools in production.  
- Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana exporters for real-time monitoring.  

## 7. Conclusion
On *first run*, a Node.js REST API built with Express consumes about **46 MB RSS**, lighter than Java but heavier than Go. Node.js remains a popular choice thanks to its vast ecosystem and strong performance for I/O-driven applications.
