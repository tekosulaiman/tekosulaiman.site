## PADI: A Deeper Understanding
**PADI (Pengembangan Aplikasi dan Data Informasi)** is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) widely used in Indonesian institutions to ensure application development is structured, documented, and aligned with governance standards.

Unlike methodologies such as **Agile** or **Waterfall**, PADI is not an optional choice but a **mandatory framework**.  
Main objectives:
- Guarantee accountability and transparency  
- Provide complete documentation for audit purposes  
- Align understanding between business stakeholders and vendors  

## PADI: Project vs Product

### Project
- **Key trait:** has a clear deadline and deliverables  
- **User awareness:** critical to ensure outcomes meet expectations  
- **Risk:** if users are not aware, results may deviate from business needs  

### Product
- **Key trait:** no strict deadline, focused on long-term roadmap  
- **User awareness:** ensures development aligns with evolving needs  
- **Risk:** without clear declaration, vendors may treat products as one-off projects  

📌 **Important:** Declare upfront whether the work is a project or a product to avoid misunderstandings between business and vendors.

## PADI: Methodology

### For Projects
- **Waterfall** → best when requirements are clear from the start  
- **Scrum/Agile** → suitable when requirements are uncertain and need iteration  

⚠️ *Note:* Forcing Scrum on a project with fixed requirements can cause unnecessary overhead.

### For Products
- **Agile (Scrum/Kanban)** → ideal for continuous evolution  
- **DevOps/Continuous Delivery** → supports ongoing updates with automated pipelines  

## PADI: Team Roles

### Project Team
- **Project Manager** → manages timeline and communication  
- **System Analyst** → bridges business needs and technical requirements  
- **Developer (Front-End, Back-End, Fullstack)** → fixed roles based on specialization  
- **Quality Control/Tester** → validates requirements and ensures quality  
- **Deployment/Support Engineer** → handles release and technical documentation  

📌 **Rigid structure:** roles cannot switch.

### Product Team
- **Product Manager** → defines vision and roadmap  
- **Product Owner** → manages backlog and priorities  
- **Scrum Master** → facilitates Agile processes  
- **Cross-functional IT Team** → flexible, members can switch roles as needed  

📌 **Adaptive structure:** roles can shift depending on sprint context.

## 🎯 Analyst Insight
- **PADI as SOP:** not a methodology, but a governance framework  
- **Project vs Product:** must be declared early to align expectations  
- **Methodology:** chosen based on requirement clarity and work type  
- **Team:** project → rigid, product → flexible
