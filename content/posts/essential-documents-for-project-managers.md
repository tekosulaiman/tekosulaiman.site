## Introduction
As a Project Manager, I have often been directly involved in projects between vendors and clients. Typically, the process begins when I meet with a client and listen to their needs. My first question is always simple but critical: *Is this system meant to improve internal productivity, or is it designed to serve the public online?*  

That distinction changes the entire direction of the project. For internal systems, the focus is efficiency and integration. For public systems, the priorities shift toward scalability, security, and user experience.  

I usually share an initial idea of the system to spark discussion. Over time, I’ve learned that documentation is not just paperwork it is the backbone of control, communication, and evaluation. Without clear documents, ideas drift, expectations clash, and projects lose direction.  

And here’s the reality: even when plans are carefully written, things rarely go exactly as expected. That’s why I always prepare options A, B, and C as backup strategies. Flexibility is part of the job. But above all, project management is **99% communication**. The remaining 1% is technical, captured in documents so nothing gets lost along the way.

## Core Documents in My Portfolio
Based on my experience, these are the documents I consistently prepare to manage projects effectively. Think of them as both a portfolio and a toolkit that keeps the project on track.

| Document                | Purpose                                      | Practical Note from Experience | Typical Content |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Price Proposal**      | Outlines estimated costs and service packages | Always the first negotiation step with clients | Cost breakdown, package options, SLA terms |
| **Project Charter**     | Defines objectives, scope, stakeholders, and authorization | Prevents miscommunication at the very beginning | Goals, sponsor, initial timeline |
| **Requirement Document**| Captures client needs and project boundaries | Essential when clients request additional features later | Features, deliverables, exclusions |
| **Project Plan**        | Provides a comprehensive roadmap (schedule, budget, risks) | Serves as the execution guide for vendors | Gantt chart, budget allocation, risk register |
| **Contract & SLA**      | Formalizes agreements between vendor and client | Basis for negotiating KPIs and deliverables | Deliverables, KPIs, penalties |
| **Risk Register**       | Identifies risks and mitigation strategies | Helps when delays or unexpected issues arise | Risk description, probability, mitigation plan |
| **Communication Plan**  | Establishes communication channels and frequency | Keeps meetings efficient and aligned | Channels, frequency, responsible contacts |
| **Status Report & Issue Log** | Tracks progress and problems | Used for weekly updates to clients | Progress %, challenges, resolutions |
| **Project Closure Report** | Summarizes outcomes and lessons learned | Provides insights for future projects | Results, lessons learned, recommendations |

## Conclusion
For me, these documents are not just templates they are part of my professional portfolio as a Project Manager. From the initial price proposal to the final closure report, each one plays a role in ensuring transparency, accountability, and project success.  

But documents alone don’t guarantee success. What truly matters is communication: listening, clarifying, negotiating, and aligning everyone involved. The documents simply make sure those conversations are captured, remembered, and acted upon.
