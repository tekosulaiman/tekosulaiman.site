## 1. Misconceptions
- Many IT teams mistakenly think **PADI** is a methodology like Agile or Waterfall.  
- In reality, PADI is a **mandatory SOP**.  
- Teams assume they can freely choose methods without following SOP.  
- PADI is often seen as *rigid* or *irrelevant* compared to modern methods.  

## 2. Lack of Socialization
- Not all developers, project managers, or vendors receive proper training on PADI.  
- Awareness is higher in **government/BUMN projects**, but lower in **startups or private companies**.  
- This gap leads to teams overlooking PADI’s role in compliance and audit.  

## 3. Bias Toward Agile/Modern Methods
- Startups and creative teams are more familiar with **Scrum/Kanban**.  
- Agile is seen as faster and more flexible.  
- SOPs like PADI are perceived as slowing down iteration.  
- In reality, **Agile can coexist with PADI**, as long as documentation is maintained.  


## 4. Documentation Seen as a Burden
- PADI requires formal documentation at every stage: **Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation**.  
- Many teams prefer quick iteration without detailed reports.  
- **Risk:** without documentation, proving process compliance during audits becomes difficult.  

## 5. Impacts of Low Awareness
- **Compliance risk** → projects may be deemed non-standard.  
- **Audit problems** → lack of PADI documentation complicates evaluations.  
- **Communication gaps** → business and vendors misalign without a shared SOP.  


## 🎯 Analyst Recommendations
- **Wider socialization** → PADI training should reach startups and private sectors.  
- **Early declaration** → clarify project vs product upfront to avoid misaligned expectations.  
- **Hybrid approach** → Agile can be used for execution, while PADI ensures documentation.  
- **Mindset shift** → treat documentation as an asset for transparency, not a burden.  

## Closing Insight
PADI is not a methodology to be compared, but a **mandatory SOP**.  
Low awareness leads to misconceptions and risks in compliance and audit.  
With clear declaration and hybrid approaches, teams can remain agile while ensuring governance.
